        <div class="title">HTML</div>
        <p><b>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</b> is the only markup language for creating web pages. It provides some titles, headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, embedded images, etc., to describe the structure of text-based and multimedia information in HTML documents.</p>
        <p><b>HTML, in full hypertext markup language,</b> a formatting system for displaying material retrieved over the Internet. Each retrieval unit is known as a Web page (from World Wide Web), and such pages frequently contain hypertext links that allow related pages to be retrieved.</p>
        <p><b>The &lt;meta> HTML element </b> represents Metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like base, link, script, style or title.</p>
        <br></br>
  
        <div class="title2"> HTML Headings</div>
        <p><b>What are HTML headings? </b> HTML defines six levels of headings. A heading element implies all the font changes, paragraph breaks before and after, and any white space necessary to render the heading. The heading elements are H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, and H6 with H1 being the highest (or most important) level and H6 the least.</p>
        <p> <b>&lt;h1></b> headings should be used for main headings, followed by <b>&lt;h2> </b> headings, then the less important <b>&lt;h3></b> , and so on. Note: Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make text BIG or bold.</p>
        <br></br>
  
        <div class="title3">HTML Element</div>
        <p><b> The &lt;ins> HTML element </b> represents a range of text that has been added to a document. You can use the &lt;del> element to similarly represent a range of text that has been deleted from the document.</p>
        <p>This attribute indicates the time and date of the change and must be a valid date with an optional time string. If the value cannot be parsed as a date with an optional time string, the element does not have an associated time stamp. For the format of the string without a time, see Format of a valid date string. The format of the string if it includes both date and time is covered in Format of a valid local date and time string.</p>
        <br></br>
  
        <div class="title3">HTML Elements Reference</div>
        <p><b> The &lt;mark> HTML</b> element represents text which is marked or highlighted for reference or notation purposes, due to the marked passage's relevance or importance in the enclosing context. The &lt;q> HTML element indicates that the enclosed text is a short inline quotation.</p>
        <p><b>The &lt;mark> tag in HTML</b> is used to define the marked text. It is used to highlight the part of the text in a paragraph.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, <b>&lt;mark>  </b>indicates a portion of the document's content which is likely to be relevant to the user's current activity. This might be used, for example, to indicate the words that matched a search operation.
          Don't use &lt;mark> for syntax highlighting purposes; instead, use the <b>&lt;span></b> element with appropriate CSS applied to it.</p>
        <br></br>
  
        <div class="title4">HTML &lt;del> Tag</div>
        <p><b>The &lt;del> tag </b> in HTML stands for delete and is used to mark a portion of text which has been deleted from the document. The deleted text is rendered as strike-through text by the web browsers although this property can be changed using CSS text-decoration property. The &lt;del> tag requires a starting and ending tag.</p>
        <p><b>The &lt;del> tag</b> defines text that has been deleted from a document. Browsers will usually strike a line through deleted text.</p>
        <br></br>
  
        <div class="title2">What are the Attribute in HTML?</div>
        <p> An <b>attribute</b> is a property name used to provide supplementary information about HTML elements. Some common examples of HTML attributes are id, class, align, etc. Many attributes are defined globally and are applied to any element, whereas we use some of them only for specific HTML elements.</p>
        <p><b><i>The HTML attributes consist of two parts  1. a name and 2. a value</i></b></p>
        <p>Names of attributes and their values are not case-sensitive. But according to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), it is recommended to use lowercase names and values. For an attribute, the name defines the property to be implemented. For example, BODY Tag, <body> carries many attributes such as bgcolor, background that you can implement for indicating the back color of your webpage, or give a specific image or background texture to your page, respectively.</p>
        <br></br>
  
        <div class="title2">id Attribute</div>
        <p><b>The id attribute</b> can be applied to assign a unique identity to any element. There can be two primary reasons for using the id attribute on an HTML element. The id attribute provides a unique identifier, which ultimately makes it possible to identify the element. When you have two elements of the same name within the same script, the id attribute helps to distinguish two similar elements through the unique ID.</p>
        <br></br>
        <div class="title2">Title Attribute</div>
        <p> This attribute gives a recommended title for your element. Its behavior depends on the element upon which it's implemented, even though this is often implemented to display a tooltip if the cursor hovers (comes over) the element.</p>
        <br></br>
        <div class="title2">Class Attribute</div>
        <p> This attribute is implemented by combining an element through a stylesheet (CSS) and identifying its class element. For more about the class attribute, you can follow the Cascading Style Sheet (CSS).</p>
        <br></br>
       <div class="title2">Style Attribute</div>
      <p>This attribute gives you a chance for specifying the rules for Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) in your element.</p>
       <br></br>
  
       <div class="title2">HTML Formatting</div>
       <p> <b>Formatting</b> is one of the crucial sections of every web development. It plays an essential role in making content attractive, readable, and appealing. Formatting can be defined as the appearance of your documentation or presentation of your HTML code in a meaningful and more beautiful way. Formatting is mainly done to make the layout attractive. HTML provides various formatting tags. They are collectively called formatting tags as they are meant for the abovementioned purpose. So, in this chapter, you will learn about these formatting tags and how to use them.</p>
       <br></br>
  
       <div class="title2">HTML Comments</div>
       <p><b>Comments</b> are an essential part of HTML; it helps to provide the details of what is written in the HTML source code. HTML comment tags are completely ignored to display by the browsers. It's used to insert comments into the source code.</p>
       <p>When more than one developer works on the same application or web page, HTML comments can help understand the source code. Comment can be used anywhere to add information about HTML, which will help developers easily understand the existing code in the future.</p>
       <br></br>
  
       <div class="title2">Writing Comments in HTML</div>
       <p> For writing comments in HTML, they begin with the <b> &lt;!-- (starting comment tag) and end with the close comment tag, i.e., --&gt;. </b> Comments in HTML can appear when someone tries to view the page's source code, but nothing is rendered within the comment tag when you run the web page through your browser.</p>
       <br></br>
    
       <div class="title2">HTML Meta Tag</div>
       <p>Meta can be called data about data. It means it holds information about other information, but the information is in the form of raw data. Meta Tags in HTML allows you to provide Metadata of your HTML page.</p>
       <br></br>
  
       <div class="title2">What is HTML Meta Tag</div>
       <p><b>Meta tags</b> are text snippets in the form of data that depict the content of your page. These meta tags and their value do not emerge on the web page you create. However, it can be seen in the source code of your HTML page. Meta tags act as small content descriptors that allow you to convey to search engines what your web page is about and what keywords it contains.</p>
       <p>Other than that, metadata can be used by browsers, web services, and APIs to take data regarding a particular page. It is to be noted that the HTML  <b> &lt;meta> </b>tag comes within the <b> &lt;head> </b> tag. Moreover, meta tags get passed in the form of a name-value pair.</p>

      <div class="title4"> JavaScript </div>
      <br>
      <p>JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.
      <p>JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.
      <p>JavaScript is easy to learn.
      <p>This tutorial will teach you JavaScript from basic to advanced.
      <p>JavaScript Can Change HTML Content
      <p>One of many JavaScript HTML methods is getElementById().
      <p>JavaScript Can Change HTML Styles (CSS)
      <p>JavaScript Can Hide HTML Elements
      <p>JavaScript Can Show HTML Elements
      <p>Showing hidden HTML elements can also be done by changing the display style:
      <p>Hiding HTML elements can be done by changing the display style:
      <p>Changing the style of an HTML element, is a variant of changing an HTML attribute:
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4"> Did you Know? </div>
      <br>
      <p>JavaScript and Java are completely different languages, both in concept and design.</p>
      <p>JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.
      <p>ECMA-262 is the official name of the standard. ECMAScript is the official name of the language.<p>
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4"> The &lt;script&gt;</div>
      <br>
      <p>In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between  &lt;script&gt; and  &lt;/script&gt; tags.<p>
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4"> JavaScript Functions </div>
      <br>
      <p>A JavaScript function is a block of JavaScript code, that can be executed when "called" for.
      <p>For example, a function can be called when an event occurs, like when the user clicks a button.<p>
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4"> JavaScript in &lt;head&gt; or &lt;body&gt;</div>
      <br>
      <p>You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.
      <p>Scripts can be placed in the &lt;body&gt;, or in the &lt;head&gt; section of an HTML page, or in both.<p>
      <p>The function is invoked (called) when a button is clicked:<p>
        
      <p>JavaScript Display Possibilities</p>
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4"> JavaScript Display Possibilities </div>
      <br>
      <p>JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:
      <br>
      <p>Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
      <p>Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
      <p>Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
      <p>Writing into the browser console, using console.log().<p>
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4">Using innerHTML &lt;div&gt;</div>
      <br>
      <p>To access an HTML element, JavaScript can use the document.getElementById(id) method.
      <p>The id attribute defines the HTML element. The innerHTML property defines the HTML content:<p>
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4"> JavaScript in Programs </div>
      <br>
      <p>A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.
      <p>In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.
      <p>A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4"> JavaScript statements</div>
      <br>
      <p>JavaScript statements are composed of:
      <p>Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.</p>
      
      <p>This statement tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly." inside an HTML element with id="demo":</p>
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4"> JavaScript Values</div>
      <br>
      <p>The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:</p>
      <p>Fixed values
      <p>Variable values
      <p>Fixed values are called Literals.
      <p>Variable values are called Variables.
      <p>JavaScript Literals
      <br><br>
      <h3>The two most important syntax rules for fixed values are:</h3>
      <br>
      <p>1. Numbers are written with or without decimals
      <p>2. Strings are text, written within double or single quotes<p>
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4"> JavaScript Variables</div>
      <br>
      <p>In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.
      <p>JavaScript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables.
      <p>An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.<p>
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4"> JavaScript operators</div>
      <br>
      <p>JavaScript uses arithmetic operators ( + - * / ) to compute values</p>
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4"> JavaScript Expressions</div>
      <br>
      <p>An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value.
      <p>The computation is called an evaluation.
      <p>For example, 5 * 10 evaluates to 50</p>
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4"> JavaScript Keywords</div>
      <br>
      <p>JavaScript keywords are used to identify actions to be performed.
      <p>The let keyword tells the browser to create variables<p>
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4"> JavaScript Comments</div>
      <br>
      <p>Not all JavaScript statements are "executed".
      <p>Code after double slashes // or between /* and */ is treated as a comment.
      <p>Comments are ignored, and will not be executed:</p>
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4"> JavaScript Identifiers / Names</div>
      <br>
      <p>Identifiers are JavaScript names.
      <p>Identifiers are used to name variables and keywords, and functions.
      <p>The rules for legal names are the same in most programming languages.<p>
      <br><br>  
      <div class="title4"> A JavaScript name must begin with</div>
      <br>
      <p>A letter (A-Z or a-z)
      <p>A dollar sign ($)
      <p>Or an underscore (_)
      <p>Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.<p>
      <br><br> 
      <div class="title4"> JavaScript is Case Sensitive</div>
      <br>
      <p>All JavaScript identifiers are case sensitive. 
      <p>The variables lastName and lastname, are two different variables<p>
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4"> JavaScript and Camel Case</div>
      <br>
      <p>Historically, programmers have used different ways of joining multiple words into one variable name:
      
      <p>Hyphens
      <p>first-name, last-name, master-card, inter-city.<p>
      <br><br> 
      <div class="title4"> JavaScript Character</div>
      <br>
      <p>JavaScript uses the Unicode character set.
      <p>Unicode covers (almost) all the characters, punctuations, and symbols in the world.
      <p>For a closer look, please study our Complete Unicode Reference.</p>
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4"> JavaScript Comments</div>
      <br>
      <p>JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code, and to make it more readable.
      <p>JavaScript comments can also be used to prevent execution, when testing alternative code.<p>
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4"> Single Line comments</div>
      <br>
      <p>Single line comments start with //.
      <p>Any text between // and the end of the line will be ignored by JavaScript (will not be executed).<p>
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4"> Multi-line comments</div>
      <br>
      <p>Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.</p>
      <p>Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by JavaScript.
      <p>This example uses a multi-line comment (a comment block) to explain the code:
      <p>Using Comments to Prevent Execution
      <p>Using comments to prevent execution of code is suitable for code testing.
      <p>Adding // in front of a code line changes the code lines from an executable line to a comment.<p>
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4"> JavaScript Variables</div>
      <br>
      <p>4 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable:
      <p>Using var
      <p>Using let
      <p>Using const
      <p>Using nothing<p>
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4"> What are Variables?</div>
      <br>
      <p>Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).
      <p>In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the var keyword<p>
        <br><br>
      <h3>When to Use JavaScript var?</h3>
      <br>
      <div class="title4"> When to Use JavaScript var?</div>
      <br>
      <p>Always declare JavaScript variables with var,let, orconst.
      <p>The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.
      <p>The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.
      <p>If you want your code to run in older browser, you must use var.</p>
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4"> When to Use JavaScript const</div>
      <br>
      <p>If you want a general rule: always declare variables with const.
      <p>If you think the value of the variable can change, use let.
      <p>In this example, price1, price2, and total, are variables:
      <p>The two variables price1 and price2 are declared with the const keyword.
      <p>These are constant values and cannot be changed.
      <p>The variable total is declared with the let keyword.
      <p>This is a value that can be changed.</p>
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4"> Just like Algebra </div>
      <br>
      <p>Just like in algebra, variables hold value<p>
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4"> JavaScript Identifiers</div>
      <br>
      <p>All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.
      <p>These unique names are called identifiers.
      <p>Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).
      <p>The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:
      <p>Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
      <p>Names must begin with a letter
      <p>Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
      <p>Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
      <p>Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4"> The Assignment operators</div>
      <br>
      <p>In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.
      <p>This is different from algebra. The following does not make sense in algebra<p>
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4"> JavaScript Data Types</div>
      <br>
      <p>JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe".
      <p>In programming, text values are called text strings.
      <p>JavaScript can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of numbers and strings.
      <p>Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.
      <p>If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.<p>
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4"> Declaring a JavaScript Variable</div>
      <br>
      <p>Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable.
      <p>You declare a JavaScript variable with the var or the let keyword
      <p>One Statement, Many Variables
      <p>You can declare many variables in one statement.
      <p>Start the statement with let and separate the variables by comma:
      <p>Value = undefined
      <p>In computer programs, variables are often declared without a value. The value can be something that has to be calculated, or something that will be provided later, like user input.
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4"> A variable declared without a value will have the value undefined</div>
      <br>
      <p>The variable carName will have the value undefined after the execution of this statement:<p>
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4"> Re-Declaring JavaScript Variables</div>
      <br>
      <p>If you re-declare a JavaScript variable declared with var, it will not lose its value.</p>
      <p>The variable carName will still have the value "Volvo" after the execution of these statements:<p>
    
      </div>

      <div class="title2"> What is CSS?</div>
      <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. External stylesheets are stored in CSS file.</p>

      <p>CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.</p>
      <br><br>

      <div class="title4"> CSS Solved a Big Problem </div>
          <p>HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page! 
            HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:</p>

          <p>&lt;h1&gt;This is Header 1 tags&lt;/h1&gt;</p>
          <p>&lt;p&gt;This is paragraph tags&lt;/p&gt;</p>
          
          <p>When tags like &lt;font&gt;, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.</p>  
          <p>To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.</p>
          <p>CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!</p>
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4"> CSS Saves a Lot of Work! </div>
          <p>The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files with an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!</p>
     <br><br>
      <div class="title4"> CSS Syntax </div>
            
            <p>A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.</p>
            <p>The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.</p>
            <p>The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.</p>
            <p>Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.</p>
            <p>Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.<p>
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4"> CSS Selectors </div>
            <p><i>CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.</i><p><br>

            <h3>We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:</h3>
            <br>
            <p>•Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)                         </p>
            <p>•Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)</p>
            <p>•Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)                   </p>
            <p>•Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)                   </p>
            <p>•Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)      </p>
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4"> The CSS id Selector </div>
            <p>The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.</p>
            <p>The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!</p>
            <p>To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.</p>
            <p>Note: An id name cannot start with a number!</p>
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4"> The CSS class Selector </div>
              <p>The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.</p>
              <p>To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name
              <p>You can also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class.
              <p>HTML elements can also refer to more than one class.
            <p>Note: A class name cannot start with a number!</p>
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4"> The CSS Universal Selector</div>
            <p>The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.</p>
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4">The CSS Grouping Selector</div>
            <p>The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions.
              Look at the following CSS code (the h1, h2, and p elements have the same style definitions):
              It will be better to group the selectors, to minimize the code.
              To group selectors, separate each selector with a comma.</p>

      <div class="title4"> How To Add CSS </div>
            <p>When a browser reads a style sheet, it will format the HTML document according to the information in the style sheet.<p>

      <div class="title4"> Three Ways to Insert CSS </div>   <br>
        <h3>There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:</h3>
            <p>• External</p>
            <p>• Internal</p>
            <p>• Inline</p>
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4"> External CSS </div>
            <p>With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!<br>
            Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the &lt;style&gt; element, inside the head section.<br>
            An external style sheet can be written in any text editor, and must be saved with a .css extension.<br>
            The external .css file should not contain any HTML tags.</p>
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4"> Internal CSS </div>
            <p>An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.
            The internal style is defined inside the &lt;style&gt; element, inside the head section.</p>
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4"> Inline CSS</div>
            <p>An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.</p>
            <p>Tip: An inline style loses many of the advantages of a style sheet (by mixing content with presentation). Use this method sparingly.</p>
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4"> Multiple Style Sheets </div>
            <p>If some properties have been defined for the same selector (element) in different style sheets, the value from the last read style sheet will be used. </p>
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4"> Cascading Order </div> <br>
            <h3>What style will be used when there is more than one style specified for an HTML element?</h3>
            <br>
                <p>All the styles in a page will "cascade" into a new "virtual" style sheet by the following rules, where number one has the highest priority:</p>
                <p>•Inline style (inside an HTML element)</p>
                <p>•External and internal style sheets (in the head section)</p>
                <p>•Browser default</p>
                <p>So, an inline style has the highest priority, and will override external and internal styles and browser defaults.</p>
      <br><br>
      <div class="title4"> CSS Comments </div>
            <p>CSS comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your source code.Comments are used to explain the code, and may help when you edit the source code at a later date.Comments are ignored by browsers.A CSS comment is placed inside the style element, and starts with /* and ends with */:</p>

      <div class="title2"> What is PHP?</div>
      <p>PHP stands for Cascading Style Sheets. PHP describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. External stylesheets are stored in CSS file.</p>
